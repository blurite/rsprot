/**
 * A class for holding all the state of a given hitmark.
 * @param sourceIndex the index of the character that dealt the hit.
 * If the target avatar is a player, add 0x10000 to the real index value (0-2048).
 * If the target avatar is a NPC, set the index as it is.
 * If there is no source, set the index to -1.
 * The index will be used for tinting purposes, as both the player who dealt
 * the hit, and the recipient will see a tinted variant.
 * Everyone else, however, will see a regular darkened hit mark.
 * @param selfType the multi hitmark id that supports tinted and darkened variants.
 * @param otherType the hitmark id to render to anyone that isn't the recipient,
 * or the one who dealt the hit. This will generally be a darkened variant.
 * If the hitmark should only render to the local player, set the [otherType]
 * value to -1, forcing it to only render to the recipient (and in the case of
 * a [sourceIndex] being defined, the one who dealt the hit)
 * @param value the value to show over the hitmark.
 * @param selfSoakType the multi hitmark id that supports tinted and darkened variants,
 * shown as soaking next to the normal hitmark.
 * @param otherSoakType the hitmark id to render to anyone that isn't the recipient,
 * or the one who dealt the hit. This will generally be a darkened variant.
 * Unlike the [otherType], this does not support -1, as it is not possible to show partial
 * soaked hitmarks.
 * @param delay the delay in client cycles (20ms/cc) until the hitmark renders.
