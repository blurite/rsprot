/**
 * A compressed internal representation of an inventory, to be transmitted
 * with the various inventory update packets.
 * Rather than use a List<Obj>, we pool these [Inventory] instances to avoid
 * generating significant amounts of garbage.
 * For a popular server, it is perfectly reasonable to expect north of a gigabyte
 * of memory to be wasted through List<Obj> instances in the span of an hour.
 * We eliminate all garbage generation by using soft-reference pooled inventory
 * objects. While this does result in a small hit due to the synchronization involved,
 * it is nothing compared to the hit caused by garbage collection and memory allocation
 * involved with inventories.
 *
 * @property count the current count of objs in this inventory
 * @property contents the array of contents of this inventory.
 * The contents array is initialized at the maximum theoretical size
 * of the full inv update packet.
