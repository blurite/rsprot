/**
 * An implementation of the player info packet.
 * This class is responsible for tracking and building the packets each cycle.
 * This class utilizes [ReferencePooledObject], meaning instances of it will be pooled
 * and re-used as needed, as the data stored within them is relatively memory-heavy.
 *
 * @param protocol the repository of all the [PlayerInfo] objects,
 * as well as a source global information about everyone in the game.
 * As the packet is responsible for tracking everyone in the game,
 * we need to provide access to this.
 * @param localIndex the index of this local player. The index corresponds to the player's slot
 * in the world. The index will not change throughout the lifespan of a player,
 * but can change within allocations in the reference pool.
 * @param allocator the [ByteBuf] allocator responsible for allocating the primary buffer
 * the is written out to the pipeline, as well as any intermediate buffers used by extended
 * info blocks. The allocator should ideally be pooled, as we acquire a new instance with each
 * cycle. This is because there isn't necessarily a guarantee that Netty threads have fully
 * written the information out to the network by the time the next cycle comes along and starts
 * writing into this buffer. A direct implementation is also preferred, as this avoids unnecessary
 * copying from and to the heap.
 * @param oldSchoolClientType the client on which the player is logging into. This is utilized
 * to determine what encoders to use for extended info blocks.
