     * This process occurs every cycle, after high resolution indices are processed, in order to
     * get rid of any gaps that were produced as a result of it.
     *
     * A breakdown of this process:
     * At the start of a cycle, we might have indices as `[1, 7, 5, 3, 8, 65535, ...]`
     * If we make the assumption that NPCs at indices 7 and 8 are being removed from our high resolution,
     * during the high resolution processing, npc at index 8 is dropped naturally - this is because
     * the client will automatically trim off any NPCs at the end which don't fit into the transmitted
     * count. So, npc at index 8 does not count towards fragmentation, as we just decrement the index count.
     * However, index 7, because it is in the middle of this array of indices, causes the array
     * to fragment. So in order to resolve this, we will iterate the fragmented indices
     * until we have collected [highResolutionNpcIndexCount] worth of valid indices into the
     * [temporaryHighResolutionNpcIndices] array.
     * After defragmenting, our array will look as `[1, 5, 3, 65535, ...]`.
     * While it is possible to do this with a single array, it requires one to shift every element
     * in the array after the first fragmentation occurs. As the arrays are relatively small, it's
     * better simply to use two arrays that get swapped every cycle, so we simply swap
     * the [temporaryHighResolutionNpcIndices] and [highResolutionNpcIndices] arrays between one another,
