/**
 * A SHA-256 challenge is a challenge which forces the client to find a hash which
 * has at least [difficulty] number of leading zero bits in the hash.
 * As hashing returns pseudo-random results, as a general rule of thumb, the work
 * needed to solve a challenge doubles with each difficulty increase, since each
 * bit can be either true or false, and the solution must have at least [difficulty]
 * amount of false (zero) bits.
 * Since the requirement is that there are at least [difficulty] amount of leading
 * zero bits, these challenges aren't constrained to only having a single successful
 * answer.
 * @property unknown an unknown byte value that is appended to the start of each
 * base string that needs hashing. The value of this byte is **always** one in OldSchool
 * RuneScape.
 * @property difficulty the difficulty of the challenge, as explained above, is the number
 * of leading zero bits the hash must have for it to be considered successful.
 * The default difficulty in OldSchool RuneScape is 18 as of writing this.
 * When Proof of Work was first introduced, this value was 16.
 * It is possible that the value gets dynamically increased as the pressure increases,
 * or if there are a lot of requests from a single IP.
 * @property salt the salt string that is the bulk of the input to hash.
 * @property id the id of the challenge as identified by the client.
