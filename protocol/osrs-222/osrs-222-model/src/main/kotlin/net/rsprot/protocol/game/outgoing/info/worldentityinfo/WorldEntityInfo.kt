/**
 * The world entity info class tracks everything about the world entities that
 * are near this player.
 * @property localIndex the index of the local player that owns this world entity info.
 * @property allocator the byte buffer allocator used to build the buffer for the packet.
 * @property oldSchoolClientType the client type on which the player has logged in.
 * @property avatarRepository the avatar repository keeping track of every known
 * world entity in the root world.
 * @property indexSupplier the implementation returning all the indices of the world
 * entities near the local player.
 * @property renderDistance the render distance in tiles, effectively how far to render
 * world entities from the local player (or the camera pov)
 * @property currentWorldEntityId the id of the world entity on which the local player
 * currently resides.
 * @property currentCoord the current real coordinate of the local player.
 * @property buildArea the current build area of the player, this is the root base
 * map that's being rendered to the player.
 * @property highResolutionIndicesCount the number of high resolution world entity avatars.
 * @property highResolutionIndices the indices of all the high resolution avatars currently
 * being tracked.
 * @property temporaryHighResolutionIndices a temporary array of high resolution avatar indices,
 * allowing for more efficient defragmentation of the indices when indices get removed
 * from the middle of the array.
 * @property allWorldEntities the indices of all the world entities currently in high resolution,
 * provided in a list format as the server must know everything currently rendered, so it can
 * perform accurate updates to player info, npc info and zones.
 * @property addedWorldEntities the indices of all the world entities that were added within
 * this cycle after it has been computed. The server can use this information to build the
 * REBUILD_WORLDENTITY packet, which is used to actually render the instance itself.
 * @property removedWorldEntities the indices of all the world entities that were removed
 * within this cycle after it has been computed. These are only removed from the high resolution,
 * and not necessarily the world itself. This allows the server to inform NPC and player info
 * protocol to deallocate the instances.
 * @property buffer the buffer for this world entity info packet.
 * @property builtIntoPacket whether the buffer has been built into a packet,
 * which means the responsibility of releasing the buffer falls to the server.
 * If false, the protocol will release the buffer when this instance is being
 * deallocated.
 * @property exception the exception that was caught during the computations
 * of this world entity info, if any. This will be thrown as the [toPacket]
 * function is called, allowing the server to handle it from the correct
 * perspective of the caller, as the protocol itself is computed in for the
 * entire server in one go.
 * @property renderCoord if the player is currently on a world entity, this marks the coordinate
 * at which the world entity is being rendered on the root world. This allows the protocol
 * to still see other world entities nearby despite the player being in an instance.
